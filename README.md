This project is a prototype of a smart automated shop that provides service, safety, and security. It is implemented using **Arduino Uno** and **ESP8266** microcontrollers and features four main systems:

- **Automatic Cooling System**
- **Firefighting System**
- **Automated Air Conditioning System**
- **Security System** for intruder detection

## Automatic Entry Detection System

This system detects customers approaching the shop using an **ultrasonic sensor** and automatically opens the door with a **servo motor**. The door remains open until the customer enters, then closes behind them, ensuring a seamless and secure entry process.

> **Components:**
> - Servo Motor
> - Ultrasonic Sensor

## Firefighting System

The firefighting system is designed to detect and respond to fire hazards immediately. It uses a **flame sensor** to detect the presence of fire. Upon detection, a **buzzer** and an LCD display alert customers, and an **AC water pump** is activated to extinguish the fire. The pump is controlled via a **relay** to step up the voltage from 5V to 12V, ensuring effective operation.

> **Components:**
> - Flame Sensor
> - Relay
> - Buzzer
> - AC Water Pump

## Automated Air Conditioning System

This system monitors temperature and humidity using a **DHT11 sensor**. When either parameter exceeds a predefined threshold, a 12V fan is activated. The fan is controlled via a transistor, which steps up the voltage from 5V (provided by the Arduino) to 12V. Temperature and humidity readings are displayed on an LCD screen.

> **Components:**
> - 12V Fan
> - DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor
> - LCD with I2C
